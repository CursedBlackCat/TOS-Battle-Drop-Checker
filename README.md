# TOS Battle Drop Checker

The TOS Battle Drop Checker takes the com.madhead.tos.en.v2.playerprefs.xml file from the English verison of Madhead's Tower of Saviors game as an input and outputs what the player will receive as loot for each wave of enemies. This program only works with the Android version of the game.

This is the core code for the Battle Drop Checker, reading from a file named com.madhead.tos.en.v2.playerprefs.xml in the classpath and outputting to the standard Java console. **This version is not intended to be used as a standalone application.** The code will be implemented into more convenient ways of input/output, such as through a Discord bot, a GUI applcation, or an Android app.

If you encounter any issues while using the program, please open an issue on this repository so that I may investigate.
